# Introduction

This package implements means for drawing data in tabular form and it is
intended as a substitution of the Go standard package `tabwriter`. Its design is
based on the functionality of tables in LaTeX but extends its functionality in
various ways.

# Installation

    $ go get github.com/clinaresl/table
    
To try the different examples given in the package change dir to
